Process controller pseudocode

On start{
Initialise heater safety TC's, and check they are reading
Check cathode flow signal is present, and within expected limits
Connect to i2c pwm outs
Initialise RH+T sensors and determine which are connected
Assign RH+T sensors to rig locations? Use pointers?
Read RH+T sensors, check within expected values
Check which pressure sensors are connected
Assign pressure sensors to rig locations? use pointers?
Initialise anode flow controller
Connect with data logger
Conenct with load controller
connect with safety controller
Connect to i2c pwm outs

Offer performance of check routine via interface
